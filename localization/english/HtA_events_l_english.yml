 DAU_succession_events.1.t: "An Heir for Daufinat"
 DAU_succession_events.1.d: "Our childless duke must make a decision."
 DAU_succession_events.1.f: "Of late, the Duke has become sicklier and sicklier, before his time. His only son, Carle, died in an accident while hunting in 1829. After one of his recent bouts of illness, he agreed to begin the search for an heir. One candidate is his cousin, Bernat, whose connections to house de Mauguio will serve in cementing relationships with Aquitània. There is also Raimond, the eldest of his sister Eleonora, who married the younger brother of the Duke of Lombardy. Finally, his second cousin, once-removed, Count Aymon of Chambéri. After identifying the candidates, he spent some time with each to get to know them. Guigo is now certain that the man he chooses will lead the Daufinens people into the future."
