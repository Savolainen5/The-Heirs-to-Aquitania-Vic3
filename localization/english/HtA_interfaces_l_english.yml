 HtA_MOD_NOTES: "Welcome to this very early version of the mod! If you happened to play HtA2 (in Victoria II), then you may find a lot of things that look quite different!

We hope you will enjoy exploring the new world of HtA3!\n\n -Savs and the HtA Team \n\n #I Click the button at the right to get started. \n\n #N Change this to fit different resolution sizes!"
