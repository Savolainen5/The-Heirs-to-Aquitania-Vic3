 HtA_INTRODUCTION: "The Heirs to Aquitània"
 HtA_MOD_NOTES: "Welcome to this early version of the mod! If you happened to play HtA2 (in Victoria II), then you may find a lot of things that look quite different! In light of inspirations from new megacampaigns and input from a growing team, we have made it rather more plausible, while still maintaining fun. We hope you enjoy exploring the new world of HtA3!\n\n It's important to point out that as of April 2023  there is no HtA-specific content yet in the mod as we're in the midst of a major rework. Apologies for the delay - real life takes priority atimes! Check back in now and then to see what we've made!\n\n -Savs and the rest of the HtA Team \n\n #I Click the button at the right to get started.# \n\n #N Let us know if this somehow looks funny on your screen with its different resolution!#!"
