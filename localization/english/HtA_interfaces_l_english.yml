 HtA_INTRODUCTION: "The Heirs to Aquitània"
 HtA_MOD_NOTES: "Welcome to this very early version of the mod! If you happened to play HtA2 (in Victoria II), then you may find a lot of things that look quite different! In light of inspirations from new megacampaigns and input from a growing team, we have made it rather more plausible, while still maintaining fun. We hope you enjoy exploring the new world of HtA3!\n\n It's important to point out that as of 25 October there is no HtA-specific content yet in the mod. That is the immediate focus since the map is more or less done, so check back in now and then to see what we've made!\n\n -Savs and the rest of the HtA Team \n\n #I Click the button at the right to get started. \n\n #N To do: Figure out how to change this to fit different resolution sizes!"
