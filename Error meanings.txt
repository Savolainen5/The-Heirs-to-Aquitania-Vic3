#So you're looking at the error logs trying to understand what the errors mean because you want that silly deer with glasses to go away? Here are some that I've found:

[12:51:28][jomini_script_system.cpp:262]: Script system error!
  Error: create_building effect [ Scoped object is not valid. Type: State NULL_STATE (x000000) ]
  Script location: file: common/history/buildings/10_india.txt line: 766
  
The building belongs to a state region which isn't actually owned by the tag in question (e.g. in the buildings file it's owned by BIC, but in the states file it's owned by HYD)

Same for pops, too.

IDK, so many errors pop up from removing tags, but not all references everywhere.
