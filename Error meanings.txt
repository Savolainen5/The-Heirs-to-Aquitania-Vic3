#So you're looking at the error logs trying to understand what the errors mean because you want that silly deer with glasses to go away? Here are some that I've found:

1

[12:51:28][jomini_script_system.cpp:262]: Script system error!
  Error: create_building effect [ Scoped object is not valid. Type: State NULL_STATE (x000000) ]
  Script location: file: common/history/buildings/10_india.txt line: 766
  
The building belongs to a state region which isn't actually owned by the tag in question (e.g. in the buildings file it's owned by BIC, but in the states file it's owned by HYD)

Same for pops, too.

IDK, so many errors pop up from removing tags, but not all references everywhere in the history

[jomini_script_system.cpp:262]: Script system error!
  Error: create_state effect [ Province 'x4C1EFA' crossing multiple state regions ]
  Script location: file: common/history/states/HtA_North_Ameriga.txt line: 787
  
  A province is listed in different states in map_data and in history. It may not be the province that's reported. My solution is to go and copy the province list from one of the files and paste it into the other.
