How to create split states quickly

IMPORTANT: This is a rather complicated process, but when you get used to it, it's far easier and quicker than any other method I've yet heard of. I've been using this method 

Cynic came up with most of this.

1. Open the provinces file in GIMP (maybe PS works too, I've never used it)
2. Select all the provinces in the state you want to move
3. Copy them to a new file with a transparent background
4. Convert the image mode from RGB to Indexed
5. Export the indexed palette as a .txt document (this now gives you a list of hex values)
6. Edit them all (using macros ideally to speed it up) to be in the correct format and with a | between each entry so we can do regex magic (x111111 |x222222 |x333333 etc)
7. Copy the full list and use your favourite text editor with the regex search mode to replace all of the list with nothing
8. Go back to your list and remove all the |
9. Copy that new list to the new split part of the state (whose entry you need to make)
